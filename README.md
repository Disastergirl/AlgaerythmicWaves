# AlgaerythmicWaves
Algaerythmic Waves is an immersive and interactive installation that turns environmental data (flow, temperature, nutrients, bloom signals) into a live system synchronized with EEG and gesture input. Instead of control, it uses entrainment, creating a feedback loop between bodies and algal dynamics.
