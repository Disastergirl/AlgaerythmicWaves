# AlgaerythmicWaves
Algaerhythmic Waves is an immersive, modular, and interactive installation by Kimberley Bianca and Tyler Grimes that explores the synchronization of human and non-human rhythms through sound, movement, and generative algorithms. The project invites participants to attune to water as a process, relation, and interface. Drawing from the dynamics of water surface flows and waves, the installation frames water as “the original mirror,” translating collective presence into oscillating visual and sonic patterns shaped by algae-inspired forms. The work combines EEG brain signals using MUSE headsets, and gestural recognition using MediaPipe, and near real-time environmental data to form a generative feedback loop in which emergent audiovisual material is self-referentially played back into the space, subtly influencing how visitors move, listen, and entrain to one another and to water. Conceptually, the project draws from psychological and environmental entrainment, hydrofeminism, and deep listening.
